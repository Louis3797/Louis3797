Hey there! I'm a computer science student from Germany, with over five exciting years of programming experience under my belt. I'm deeply passionate about crafting software, tinkering with distributed systems, and diving into databases, system architecture, and data structures and algorithms.

Java and Typescript are my go-to programming languages, empowering me to bring ideas to life and create cool stuff. Along the way, I've honed my skills in data structures, algorithms, design patterns, and writing clean code for smoother development.

I'm an avid learner, always hungry for the latest tech trends and innovations.

Seeking new challenges is my forte, and I'm eager to make a difference with my skills. My journey in computer science has just begun, and I'm ready to embrace whatever comes my way. Lifelong learning is my mantra, and I can't wait to see how my tech passion shapes my future and impacts the world!
