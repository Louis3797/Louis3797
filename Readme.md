I am a computer science student from Germany with +4 years of programming experience. I am interested in many areas, from software development, distributed systems, databases to data structures and algorithms. Meanwhile I also have an eye on computer graphics and procedural generation right now. My experience in these areas is growing steadily. Currently I am learning C++, but my main languages are Java and Typescript. I also have a good knowledge of data structures and algorithms, design patterns and clean code.
